//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// ans: BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// ans: BFS

//If the tree is very wide:
// ans: DFS

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// ans: DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// ans: DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
// ans: BFS
